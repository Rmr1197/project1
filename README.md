Problem Statement
We are to answer questions that have to do with the function of a CTD device. The questions are as follows.

a. Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs deep profiler
b. Where is the maximum value of ssp in each season? Explain why the max ssp should be there?
c. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of day vs night).
d. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of season). 
e. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (effect of location).

Generally the CTD devices collecting data made more dives in shallow waters.

Deep CTD Sites

Axial Base deep winter = 2

Axial Base deep summer = 2

Oregon Offshore deep winter = 12

Oregon Offshore deep summer = 2

Oregon Slope deep winter = 1

Oregon Slope deep summer = 2

Average = 3.5 dives

Shallow CTD Sites

Axial Base shallow winter = 8

Axial Base shallow summer = 2

Oregon Offshore shallow winter = 6

Oregon Offshore shallow summer = 6

Oregon Slope shallow winter = 6

Average = 5.7 dives
	
b.	The maximum value of the speed of sound for each CTD site is generally at the greatest depth. This is because the speed of sound is dependent on salinity, temperature, and pressure. SSP has a positive relationship with these three variables. While temperature generally decreases with depth, it is a very small decrease, and generally does not affect SSP as much as the other two variables. It is common to see salinity increase with depth because saltwater is more dense than freshwater, so it falls to greater depths. Fluid mechanics tells us that hydrostatic pressure increases linearly with depth.

This is an example taken from the Axial Base deep rifiler during the Winter. We notice the minimum value to the left which is common for an ssp profile. At this point, the effect of salinity and pressure overtakes temperature in determining the speed of sound as depth further decreases.

c. 
I did not have time to get the day and night breakdown to analyze.

d. 	
Axial Base deep profiler  
![](https://github.com/Rmr1197/project1/blob/master/images/14.PNG)
I noticed a change in depth for the minimum ssp. The summer profile showed a slightly deeper value for the average minimum speed of sound.

Axial Base Shallow profiler 
![](https://github.com/Rmr1197/project1/blob/master/images/15.PNG)
Much of the data found on the OOI website had values that were extreme, and I did not have time to go back and make corrections to these values. For this profiler we can only compare the shape which looks to be fairly similar, following similarly to the profile shape we expect to see.

Oregon Offshore Deep Profiler

We see a similar case here where the data is skewed, and it looks like the profiler did not travel very deep. Despite distortion, we can still compare the graphs and find that they have a similar trend.

Oregon Slope Deep Profiler
![](https://github.com/Rmr1197/project1/blob/master/images/17.PNG)
Here is a case where we see similar values. The speed of sound value is around 1480 at 1000 dbar. 

All other graphs were too distorted to analyze.

Here is the compared data however it was not possible to get all data on the same day due to availability.
